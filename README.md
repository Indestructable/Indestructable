Exit Velocity Project

I completed this project while taking Penn State University's DS 200 course, Introduction to Data Science, with the goal of concluding whether or not an Major League Baseball (MLB) player's average exit velocity and average launch angle could accurately predict their average homerun distance. I am very passionate about the world of baseball statistics, especially the more advanced ones, so I wanted to find out their relationship with traditional numbers like homerun distance. The attached dataset was obtained from Kaggle and was used in the attached Jupyter Notebook which shows my process for concluding that exit velocity and launch angle do not accurately predict homerun distance.
